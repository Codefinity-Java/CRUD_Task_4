# Description
Some new stock has arrived. The store owner tells you to set the quantity of all the products to 200, which were previously less than 100.

Your task is to update the quantity of all the products to 200 which were less than 100 in terms of quantity.

### Hint
Hint: Use the `UPDATE` statement with the condition `WHERE stock_quantity < 100`
